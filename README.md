# A Basic Java Servlet

At this point, we have converted our Hello.java class into a [Java Servlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet) so that we can serve up content on the Internet. Pay attention to the changes to the **pom.xml** and the **Hello.java** files. Also, take note of the new src/main/webapp directory which contains the **web.xml** file.

## Compile
```
mvn package
```

## Run
```
mvn jetty:run
```

Next step, go to branch [Step_08](https://github.com/JUGGL/Hello/tree/Step_08)

# A Gradle Project

We can also ask our build tools to **run** our applications as well. In **Gradle**, we use the **application** plugin and we specify the **mainClass** so that Gradle knows which class to execute for us.

## Compile
```
gradle jar
```

## Run
```
gradle run
```

Next step, go to branch [Step_06](https://github.com/JUGGL/Hello/tree/Step_06)

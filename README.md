# A Basic Java program with package heirarchy

In order to be able to organize code more effectively, Java allows us to define "packages" so that we can put code together which is closely related and assign it to a **namespace** so that it is easily identifiable as being related to other classes in that same package.

## Compile
```
javac us/juggl/hello/Hello.java
javac 
```

## Run
```
java us.juggl.hello.Hello
```
